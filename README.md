I love to code, build useful stuff and take new challenges everyday. I have around 5 years' worth of experience working on various stages of the professional application development process.

In recent years, I have completed multiple projects which are giving convincing output in real world and in my current company. I have been coding in Full Stack for last few years.

I have already took part to build several exciting projects by leading and working with different teams. Working under extreme pressure with limited time and quick learning are stronger part of my career.

Skills: PHP-Laravel, VueJs, ReactJs, MySQL, CSS
